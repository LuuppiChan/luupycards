# Luupycards
Flip card game written in Python
I was inspired to make a this thanks to "[Nihongo Quest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556070/Nihongo_Quest/)".

# Why the name?
`Luup`: Part of my nickname Luuppi (which literally means "loop") and it kind of references to the gameplay where you can play the cards on a loop.

`y`: I added it since it's written in Python and sounds better than "Luupcards"

`cards`: This is a flip **CARD** game

#### Pronunciation:
`Luupy` like "loopy", the other part is self-explanatory
