# Luupycards
Flip card game written in Python

# Why the name?
`Luup`: Part of my nickname Luuppi (which literally means "loop") and it kind of references to the gameplay where you can play the cards on a loop.

`y`: I added it since it's written in Python and sounds better than Loopcards

`cards`: This is a flip **CARD** game
